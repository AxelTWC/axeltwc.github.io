            <p>
              I‚Äôm Axel Tang, building business and projects since 14. 
              <br></br><br></br>I‚Äôve contributed to projects like UMPLE serving millions of NA students and was the main force behind <br></br>HumblexMC serving tens of thousands of players globally meanwhile tried to sustain a 8 year eco-system. 
              <br></br><br></br>I came from humble beginnings, supporting my family by being selfless from a young age <br></br>such as saving up and disconnect from the norm then striving for excellence in my studies. 
              <br></br><br></br>Originally with a core foundation in computer science and a focus of software engineering, <br></br>I was also lucky enough to be guided by industrial leaders about next generation technology.
              <br></br><br></br>Being privilleged to be in the same school with AI Pioneers such as Geoffrey Hinton and Ilya Sutskever. <br></br>I am aiming to expand while honing my knowledge of big data, artifical intelligence and machine learning.<br></br>Needless to say, I foresee myself contributing to the rapid growth of the next state-of-the-art tech revolution.

        <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
        <p>
          I am born with no technological background, only a PC and a game which led me to open a ‚Äústudio/service‚Äù running for 8 years during my childhood, through it, <b>I learnt that technology is the key to improve the world in a vast ways unimaginable.</b> On top of that, with my medical/nursing background from my parents, I always strive to take care and be concerned about others over myself. 
          <br></br><br></br>
          During my Bachelors Years, I got introduced to AI chatbots, the year which OpenAI publicly released their first model. <b>At that time, I did not have a clue about the topics of artificial intelligence as I was focusing on how to get my family out of financial pressure and doing the "right" thing</b>. Therefore, I wanted to build a career through software, I wasn‚Äôt particularly interested in developing websites or front-end related but rather liked working on lower levels such as the source to make a programming language work (Honors Project) or something exciting which could be also seen out of the software spectrum such as robotics or other sorts of engineering tied to SWE (internal tools and much more).
          <br></br><br></br>
          Over the years with one of my relatives working in cutting edge tech and after reading and watching the possibilities of where I could reach myself for, <b>I found out the excitement and imminent advancement of AI aiding the world</b>. Since my emphasis on my Master‚Äôs Degree is under Data Analyst and Machine Learning, I view myself as a <b>engineer-doctor-nurse for AI/Machines and hope to either take on roles in training (nurturing machines) or AGI robotics.</b> 
          <br></br><br></br>
          My stance is that I love helping and seeing things work regardless of what they are or who they are. The thrill of success after a long run just excites me a lot. <b>I hope to see more nurses around the world taking care of people in need; and I want to do my part to leverage machines to be able to take care of people who may seem out of reach to me.</b>

        <h3>AI Insight</h3>
        <p>
          Artificial Intelligence is the next frontier of technology, same as the invention of the internet, smartphone and vehicles. It is transforming industries, enhancing productivity, and reshaping the way we live and work.
          <br></br><br></br>
          Here are some areas I find particularly that I like to discuss on:
          <br></br><br></br>

            <h4>Healthcare AI</h4>
            <p>
              Coming with a family medical background, although I am not a medical professional, I see the potential of AI in revolutionizing healthcare. From diagnostics to personalized treatment, AI can enhance patient care and outcomes.
            </p>

          <div className="card">
            <Activity size={40} className="insight-icon" />
            <h4>AGI & Robotics</h4>
            <p>
              The topic of AGI and Robotics is similar to how cars, internet and smartphones revolutionized the world. It is true that AI adoption could take time, however the current pace of AI is exponentially increasing unlike the development of others; With how it shaped the software industry, I expect that over short periods of time, it will affect other industires too.

            <h4>Responsible AI</h4>
            <p>
              Although inevitable, ethical implications cannot be ignored. Through attending live talks from Geoffrey Hinton in Toronto, I see the importance of responsible AI development to ensure safety and fairness.
